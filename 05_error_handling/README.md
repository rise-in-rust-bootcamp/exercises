# Hands-on Task - Adding error handling to the basic banking system

The program will handle errors related to depositing and withdrawing money from the bank account.

## Steps

1. Modify the `deposit` method of the `Account` Trait to return a `Result<(), String>` instead of `()`. The Result type will be used to handle errors. The `String` type will be used to hold the error message.
2. Modify the `withdraw` method of the `Account` Trait to return a `Result<(), String>` instead of `()`. The Result type will be used to handle errors. The `String` type will be used to hold the error message.
3. In the implementation of the `deposit` method for `BankAccount`, use the `Ok(())` variant to indicate success and the `Err("Error message".to_string())` variant to indicate failure.
4. In the implementation of the `withdraw` method for `BankAccount`, use the `Ok(())` variant to indicate success and the `Err("Error message".to_string())` variant to indicate failure.
5. In the `main` function, create two `BankAccount` instances with different account numbers and holder names.
6. Call the `deposit` method on one of the accounts, passing in a deposit amount. Handle any errors returned by the deposit method using a match statement.
7. Call the `withdraw` method on the other account, passing in a withdraw amount. Handle any errors returned by the withdraw method using a match statement.
8. Call the `balance` method on both accounts and print the result to the console.
9. Compile and run the program to ensure it works as expected.

## Checklist

1. Modify the `deposit` method of the `Account` Trait to return a `Result<(), String>` instead of `()`.
2. Modify the `withdraw` method of the `Account` Trait to return a `Result<(), String>` instead of `()`.
3. In the implementation of the `deposit` method for `BankAccount`, use the Ok(()) variant to indicate success and the `Err("Error message".to_string())` variant to indicate failure.
4. In the implementation of the `withdraw` method for `BankAccount`, use the `Ok(())` variant to indicate success and the `Err("Error message".to_string())` variant to indicate failure.
