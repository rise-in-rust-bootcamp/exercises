# Hands-on Task - Implement a basic program to concatenate strings

The program will take two strings as input, concatenate them, and then print the result without violating any ownership rules.

## Steps

Create a function called `concatenate_strings` that takes two string slices as arguments and returns a new String as the result of concatenating the two input strings.


Inside the `concatenate_strings` function, create a new `String` called result. Use the `push_str()` method to append the contents of the first input string slice, followed by the second input string slice.


Return the `result` string from the function.


In the `main` function, create two `String` variables, `string1` and `string2`, and initialize them with appropriate values.


Call the `concatenate_strings` function with references to `string1` and `string2` as arguments (using string slices). Store the result in a new variable called `concatenated_string`.


Print the `concatenated_string` variable to the console.


Compile and run the program to ensure it works as expected

## Checklist

Write the `concatenate_strings` function signature.


Implement the `concatenate_strings` function.


Initialize two `String` variables in the `main` function.


Call the `concatenate_strings` function with `string` slices of the variables.


Print the result to the console.


Compile and run the program to test its functionality.

## How to Run

Run the program:

```sh
cargo run
```

Run unit tests

```sh
cargo test
```
